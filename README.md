## Setup ######################################################################

CloudinaryDotNet is available as NuGet package at https://nuget.org/packages/CloudinaryDotNet

Please see NuGet Documentation at http://docs.nuget.org/ for instructions of how to work with NuGet packages.

### Using Visual Studio

1. Download NuGet Package Manager at http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c
2. Use Visual Studio to create a new project and choose .NET 4.x as the target framework.
3. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and click on Manage NuGet packages...
4. Type CloudinaryDotNet in the search box at the upper right corner.
5. When CloudinaryDotNet package appears, click on the Install button.
6. After the package is installed click Close button.
7. Setup is done and you can now use CloudinaryDotNet.

### Manual setup

1. Go to https://nuget.org/packages/CloudinaryDotNet and download NuGet package.
2. NuGet package is a ZIP archive that could be extracted using any unzip tool.
3. NuGet package contains CloudinaryDotNet.dll, xml documentation and this file.

## Manual add reference to visual studio .net core or .net classic projects

1. Open cloudinary.sln in visual studio 2015 or 2017.
2. Run "build" in debug or release mode.
3. Once done, corresponding dll files: CloudinaryDotNet.dll – for .net classic projects, Cloudinary.NetCoreShared.dll – for .net core projects will appear in “bin” folders.
4. Then you can add corresponding dll file as reference in you project in solution - add refference menu.

## Try it right away

Sign up for a [free account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) so you can try out image transformations and seamless image delivery through CDN.

*Note: Replace `demo` in all the following examples with your Cloudinary's `cloud name`.*  

Accessing an uploaded image with the `sample` public ID through a CDN:

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sample.jpg

![Sample](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_0.4/sample.jpg "Sample")

Generating a 150x100 version of the `sample` image and downloading it through a CDN:

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill/sample.jpg

![Sample 150x100](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill/sample.jpg "Sample 150x100")

Converting to a 150x100 PNG with rounded corners of 20 pixels: 

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill,r_20/sample.png

![Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill,r_20/sample.png "Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG")

For plenty more transformation options, see our [image transformations documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).

Generating a 120x90 thumbnail based on automatic face detection of the Facebook profile picture of Bill Clinton:
 
    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/facebook/c_thumb,g_face,h_90,w_120/billclinton.jpg
    
![Facebook 90x120](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/facebook/c_thumb,g_face,h_90,w_120/billclinton.jpg "Facebook 90x200")

For more details, see our documentation for embedding [Facebook](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/facebook_profile_pictures) and [Twitter](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/twitter_profile_pictures) profile pictures.

## Usage

### Configuration

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `cloud_name` parameter set. 
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads, eager sprite generation) must have the `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters set. 
See [API, URLs and access identifiers](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/solution_overview#account_and_api_setup) for more details.

Setting the `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters can be done either directly in each call to a Cloudinary method, 
by when initializing the Cloudinary object, or by using the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable / system property.

The main entry point of the library is the Cloudinary object.

    CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary cloudinary = new CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary();

NOTE: This call assumes that CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable is set. If not, please use parameterized constructor:

	CloudinaryDotNet.Account account =
		new CloudinaryDotNet.Account("my_cloud_name", "my_api_key", "my_api_secret");
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary cloudinary = new CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary(account);

### Embedding and transforming images

Any image uploaded to Cloudinary can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates the url for accessing an uploaded `sample` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(100).Height(150).Crop("fill")).BuildUrl("sample.jpg");

Another example, emedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail: 

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(90).Height(90).Crop("thumb").Gravity("face")).BuildUrl("woman.jpg");

You can provide either a Facebook name or a numeric ID of a Facebook profile or a fan page.  
             
Embedding a Facebook profile to match your graphic design is very simple:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Action("facebook").Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(130).Height(130).Crop("fill").Gravity("north_west")).BuildUrl("billclinton.jpg");
                           
Same goes for Twitter:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Action("twitter_name").BuildUrl("billclinton.jpg");

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary/image/upload/see_more_bullet.png) **See [our documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dotnet_image_manipulation) for more information about displaying and transforming images in .NET**.

### Upload

Assuming you have your Cloudinary configuration parameters defined (`cloud_name`, `api_key`, `api_secret`), uploading to Cloudinary is very simple.
    
The following example uploads a local JPG to the cloud: 
    
    CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams uploadParams = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams()
	{
		File = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.FileDescription(@"c:\mypicture.jpg")
	};
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadResult uploadResult = cloudinary.Upload(uploadParams);
        
The uploaded image is assigned a randomly generated public ID. The image is immediately available for download through a CDN:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.BuildUrl(String.Format("{0}.{1}", uploadResult.PublicId, uploadResult.Format));
        
    http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/biricaezlhduexarhzsb.jpg

You can also specify your own public ID:    
    
    CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams uploadParams = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams()
	{
		File = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.FileDescription(@"c:\mypicture.jpg"),
		PublicId = "sample_remote_file"
	};
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadResult uploadResult = cloudinary.Upload(uploadParams);

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.BuildUrl("sample_remote_file.jpg");

    http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/sample_remote_file.jpg

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary/image/upload/see_more_bullet.png) **See [our documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dotnet_image_upload) for plenty more options of uploading to the cloud from your .NET code**.        
        
### imageTag

Returns an html image tag pointing to Cloudinary.

Usage:

    string tag = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Format("png").Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(100).Height(100).Crop("fill")).BuildImageTag("sample");

	# <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/c_fill,h_100,w_100/sample.png' width='100' height='100'/>
